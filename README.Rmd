<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project: the package eDASH
This project consists in the design and development of interactive dashboards for the visualization of energy data. In particular, we propose to interact with the data in a deeper way by modifying the hyperparameters of the code directly from the UI, giving the user great flexibility in the exploration. In addition, we created an "Advanced" section through which the users can perform advanced data analysis workflows, ranging from daily load profile clustering to Adaptive Symbolic Approximation (ASAX).

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Online (shinyapps.io)
From this [link](https://roberto-chiosa.shinyapps.io/BAEDA_DASHBOARD_STUDENTS/) it is possible to access and use the dashboard online without having R or Rstudio installed on your computer. Thanks to [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/) the whole application is hosted online and accessible without any requirements other than an internet connection.

> :warning: **Warning**: Since the online hosting is performed through the free account, a limit of 25 active hours is set from the server. If this limit is exceded the app will not be available untill the next month cycle. Therefore, we suggest to exploit the dashboard functionalities by cloning the repository on your local machines as explained in the following.

### Online (AWS)
From this [link](https://roberto-chiosa.shinyapps.io/BAEDA_DASHBOARD_STUDENTS/) it is possible to access and use the dashboard online without having R or Rstudio installed on your computer. Thanks to [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/it/) the whole application is hosted on a virtual machine (EC2) accessible without any requirements other than an internet connection.

### Local (Version Control)
This kind of installation is suitable for developers who have the permission to download and modify the code. The process described allows you to get the whole GitHub repository on your computer.

Be sure to have the latest version of [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) installed, then follow these steps:

1. In RStudio, start a new Project by following this path _"File > New Project > Version Control > Git"_;
2. In _"Repository URL"_, paste this URL `https://github.com/baeda-polito/dashboard-student`;
3. Accept the default _"Project directory name"_ which coincides with the GitHub repo name `dashboard-student`;
4. Chose a local path to save the repository on your computer;
5. Click _"Create Project"_.

### Local (Package version)
This kind of installation is suitable for those who have the permission to download the code and want to run the dashboard locally as if it was a R package.

Install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/baeda-polito/dashboard-student")
```

Then you can run the application by simply typing:
``` {r, eval = FALSE}
library("eDASH")
eDASH::run_app()
```

<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->
## Contributing
Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**. If you want to propose a feature or report a bug please open a new [issue](https://github.com/baeda-polito/dashboard-student/issues). If you want to contribute to the code, follow these steps:

1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch, called for example `MYBRANCH`  (`git checkout -b feature/MYBRANCH`);
3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`);
4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/MYBRANCH`);
5. Open a Pull Request.

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.
